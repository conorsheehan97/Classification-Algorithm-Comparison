# Classification-Algorithm-Comparison
Here, we again use a manually labelled set of 1000 ImageJ pore samples to compare the performance of seven Parameter Optimised Classification algorithms. We then extropolate the best performing model to a larger, unlabelled 100,000 pore dataset, to assess pore distribution accross Gas Flows
